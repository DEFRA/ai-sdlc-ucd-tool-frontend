Frontend Implementation User Stories

**Story 1.1**: **Core Configuration Module** **Description**:
Create a centralized configuration module that extracts all Azure AD OAuth settings, Redis connection details, and session management parameters. This module should support environment-specific configurations and validate required settings on startup.
**Integration**: This foundational story provides the configuration backbone that all subsequent authentication stories will depend upon for Azure AD endpoints, client credentials, and Redis connection settings.

**Story 1.2**: **Redis Session Store Integration** **Description**:
Implement a Redis client wrapper with methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting sessions. Include connection management, error handling, and automatic reconnection logic to ensure session reliability.
**Integration**: Builds on configuration from 1.1 and provides the session persistence layer that stories 1.5 and 1.6 will utilize for storing and retrieving authentication tokens.

**Story 1.3**: **Session ID Generation and Cookie Management** **Description**:
Implement secure session ID generation using the provided crypto function and create HAPI plugins for setting, reading, and clearing session cookies. Include cookie security settings (httpOnly, secure, sameSite) configured from the central config.
**Integration**: Uses configuration from 1.1 and provides the session identification mechanism that 1.2 will use as keys for Redis storage and all subsequent stories will use for tracking user sessions.

**Story 1.4**: **Azure AD OAuth Routes** **Description**:
Create HAPI routes for initiating OAuth flow (/auth/login) and handling the OAuth callback (/auth/callback). The login route should generate state parameters and redirect to Azure AD, while the callback validates state and exchanges authorization codes.
**Integration**: Leverages configuration from 1.1 and session management from 1.3, setting up the entry points for the authentication flow that 1.5 will complete with token exchange.

**Story 1.5**: **Token Exchange and Session Creation** **Description**:
Implement the authorization code to token exchange with Azure AD, extract user information from tokens (user_id from oid claim), and create Redis sessions with the complete session data structure. Include proper error handling for failed exchanges.
**Integration**: Continues from the OAuth callback in 1.4, uses Redis store from 1.2 and session IDs from 1.3 to persist authentication state that 1.6 will validate on subsequent requests.

**Story 1.6**: **Session Validation Middleware** **Description**:
Create HAPI authentication strategy that validates session cookies, retrieves session data from Redis, and checks token expiry. Include logic to attach user context to requests and handle expired sessions with redirects to login.
**Integration**: Uses all previous components (config from 1.1, Redis from 1.2, cookies from 1.3) to protect routes and provide the authentication context that 1.7 will use for API requests.

**Story 1.7**: **Authenticated API Request Handler** **Description**:
Implement a service module that automatically attaches Bearer tokens from the session to outgoing backend API requests. Include methods for common HTTP verbs and automatic error handling for 401 responses.
**Integration**: Depends on validated sessions from 1.6 to retrieve access tokens and provides the authenticated communication layer that 1.8 will use for token refresh scenarios.

**Story 1.8**: **Token Refresh Logic** **Description**:
Create a token refresh service that monitors token expiry and automatically refreshes access tokens using refresh tokens before they expire. Update Redis sessions with new tokens and handle refresh token expiry with re-authentication.
**Integration**: Extends the API handler from 1.7 with pre-flight token checks and uses all previous components to maintain continuous authenticated sessions.

**Story 1.9**: **Logout Functionality** **Description**:
Implement logout route that clears session cookies, removes Redis sessions, and optionally redirects to Azure AD logout endpoint. Include support for post-logout redirect URLs and proper cleanup of all session artifacts.
**Integration**: Provides clean session termination using components from 1.2 (Redis deletion) and 1.3 (cookie clearing), completing the full authentication lifecycle started in 1.4.

**Story 1.10**: **Error Handling and User Feedback** **Description**:
Create comprehensive error handling for all authentication scenarios including Azure AD errors, network failures, and session issues. Implement user-friendly error pages with Nunjucks templates and appropriate logging for debugging.
**Integration**: Wraps all previous stories with proper error boundaries, providing graceful degradation and clear user communication throughout the authentication flow implemented in stories 1.4 through 1.9.
